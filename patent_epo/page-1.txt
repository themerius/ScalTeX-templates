Description
Technical Field

[0001] This invention relates to a remedy for overactive bladder comprising (R)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-4'-[2-[(2-hy-
droxy-2—pheny|ethy|) amino] ethyl] acetic acid anilide or a salt thereof as an active ingredient.

Background Art

[0002] Bladder of mammals is under a dual control of autonomic nerve and detrusor relaxes via an adrenaline [3
receptor by stimulation of sympathetic nerve upon urination while, upon excretion of urine, it contracts via a muscarine
receptor by stimulation of parasympathetic nerve. As a remedy for overactive bladder resulted when the dual control
as such is unbalanced, anticholinergic agents such as propiverine hydrochloride and oxybutynin hydrochloride have
been mostly used at present. However, there are intractable cases showing resistance to such compounds and there
are side effects caused by anticholinergic agents such as urinaw dysfunction and dry mouth and, therefore, it is the
current status that satisfactory clinical results are not always achieved.

[0003] Further, as a result of increase in population of aged people in recent years, numbers of patients suffering
from overactive bladder are increasing year by year and, in view of QOL (quality of life) of patients, there has been a
brisk demand for the development of new drugs.

[0004] The present inventors reported in Example 41 of a pamphlet of International Laid-Open WO 99/20607 that
(Fl)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-4'-[2-[(2-hydroxy-2-pheny|ethyl)amino]-ethyl]acetic acid anilide dihydrochloride has both
promotion action for insulin secretion and enhancing action for insulin sensitivity and further has anti-obese and anti-
hyperlipemic actions whereby it is a useful compound for the treatment of diabetes mellitus but there is neither sug-
gestion nor disclosure forthe therapeutic use for overactive bladder (referto Patent Document 1).

[0005] In the meanwhile, in a pamphlet of International Laid-Open W0 98/07445, as an agent for prevention and
treatment of urinary frequency and urinary incontinence containing a drug having stimulating action to a B3-adrenaline
receptor as an active ingredient, there is mentioned that CGP-1 2,1 77A represented by the following chemical structural
formula has a relaxation action for bladder (referto Patent Document 2). CGP-1 2,1 77A has been known as a selective
drug having stimulating action to a l33—adrenaline receptor (referto Non-Patent Documents 1 and 2).

[0006] In a pamphlet of International Laid-Open WO 99/31045, compounds represented by the following formula are
mentioned as having a stimulating action to a B3-adrenaline receptor and as an agent for prevention or treatment of
diseases caused by obesity, hyperglycemia and acceleration of movement of intestinal tract and diseases caused by
urinary frequency or urinary incontinence, melancholia, biliary calculus or acceleration of bile duct movement (referto
Patent Document 3).
