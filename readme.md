# Documentation

There are three basis types:

 * Areal (or Zone)
 
   An areal within a document, for example most academic documents have areals
   like titlepage, foreword, table of contents, main document, appendix,
   literatur, index. 
 
 * Page
 
   Every areal is filled with a least one page, and there can be several
   page types within a document, for example normal A4 pages
   or landscape pages for big tables or a special titlepage.
 
 * Entity
 
   This are the elementary elements, which are hooked into the pages, like
   headings, texts, figures and so on.
